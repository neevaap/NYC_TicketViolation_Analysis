### NYC Parking Violations Analysis and Predictions

## Overview
This project is part of the CS 777 course and involves analyzing and predicting NYC parking violations using machine learning models and statistical methods. It was developed by Tanvi Sharma and Shivani Parab.

## Key Features
- Analysis of parking violation patterns and enforcement strategies.
- Hypothesis testing to derive insights from parking violations.
- Machine learning models to predict parking violation revenue and trends.

## Analysis and Hypotheses  
- **Hypothesis 1**: Streets with the highest fines.
- **Hypothesis 2**: Frequency of parking violations among luxury vehicles.
- **Hypothesis 3**: Most common violation types.
- **Hypothesis 4**: Top issuing agencies.

## Machine Learning Models
